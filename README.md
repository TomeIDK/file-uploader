# C File Uploader
This is my first C project that acts with a client and server to upload binary files (images) to a specified dir in the /uploads directory.  

I will probably work on this project slowly to improve my C.  

Any suggestions are welcome so feel free to message me anywhere!  

**Usage: ./client <file_path> <target_dir>**
